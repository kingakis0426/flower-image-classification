# Flower Image Classification ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¼ðŸŒ¹

This project builds a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images of flowers (roses, tulips, daffodils, sunflowers, and dandelions) from the Flowers dataset. Achieved high accuracy using data augmentation and a simple model architecture.

ðŸ“Š Final result: The model accurately predicted flower types, as shown in the sample image.

## Technologies used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib

ðŸŒ¸ A simple flower image classifier built with TensorFlow and CNNs, trained on the official Flowers dataset.
